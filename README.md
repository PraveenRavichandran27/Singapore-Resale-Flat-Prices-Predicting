# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting

##Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The model is based on historical data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) and helps potential buyers and sellers estimate the resale value of a flat, considering various factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration.
Motivation
The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive and dynamic, with multiple factors influencing the prices. Estimating the resale value can be challenging for both buyers and sellers. This project addresses this challenge by developing a predictive model that estimates resale prices, providing valuable insights to users and aiding in making informed decisions.

##Scope of the Project:
The project involves the following key tasks:
1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
o	Collect historical resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to the present.
o	Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.
2.	Feature Engineering:
o	Extract relevant features, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
o	Create additional features if necessary to enhance prediction accuracy.
3.	Model Selection and Training:
o	Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression, such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests.
o	Train the model on the historical data, with a portion of the dataset reserved for validation.
4.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluate the model's performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) Score.
5.	Streamlit Web Application Development:
o	Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
o	Allow users to input details of a flat (e.g., town, flat type, storey range) and predict the resale price using the trained model.
6.	Deployment on Render:
o	Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform, making it accessible to users online.
7.	Testing and Validation:
o	Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.

##Results
The deployed application will benefit both buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market by providing a reliable estimate of resale prices. This project also serves as a practical demonstration of applying machine learning to real estate and web development.
